##VC Feedback Survey

In 2011 I was impressed by Phin Barnes' [feedback survey](http://www.sneakerheadvc.com/2011/11/17/continuous-feedback-founder-response-sneakerheadvc-product/) in an effort to improve his own ["product"](http://www.sneakerheadvc.com/2011/07/05/vc-product-broken/), and stored it away in the back of my head as something to do in the future.

In 2013 I created my own anonymous survey to see how I've done on my own "product". I used a lot of Phin's basic structure and added a couple wrinkles specific to me (good ideas deserve to be appropriated), and focused on the initial meeting product (not the VC support product), focusing types of things that matter in that context, including timeliness, preparedness, responsiveness, etc.

I published the aggregated results at [Founder Feedback Survey Responses](http://taylordavidson.com/2013/feedback).

I decided to share the survey struture on Github because I wanted to make it easy for anyone to copy and create their own, adding their own questions and ideas to it.

You can read the survey questions and structure [here on Github](https://github.com/tdavidson/feedback/blob/master/survey).

Enjoy.
